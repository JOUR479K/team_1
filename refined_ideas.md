# Court Scraper

We'd like to build a scraper for court dockets uploaded to the website of a specific system of courts (probably MD district courts). Here's an example of a similar web interface and wikiscraper written in Python from MinnPost: https://github.com/MinnPost/minnpost-mn-court-dockets 

Ideally, we'd also like to have a notification system for when dockets have been updated. This would involve building a basic tweetbot. If it turns out we're not great at scraping, this could be our minimum project.
